Effluent Treatment Plant or ETP is one type of waste water treatment method which is particularly designed to purify industrial waste water for its reuse and itâ€™s aim is to release safe water to environment from the harmful effect caused by the effluent.

In the jupyter notebook I have tested Random forrest, Decision Trees and SVR model on the dataset and chosen the best model based on the given results.

In the web application, I have integrated the data visulatisation of the ETP dataset, Model training on 3 different models from which 1 best model is chosen and used to make predictions on new data values.
